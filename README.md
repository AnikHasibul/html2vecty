```txt
html2vecty - A tool for transpiling html source code to vecty component!

Example usage:

1. FROM STDIN: html2vecty can transpile your code from stdin. ex:
	$ cat index.html | html2vecty
or
	$ echo '<h1>Hey Vecty</h1>' | html2vecty

2. FROM FILES: html2vecty can transpile your code from files. ex:
	$ html2vecty index.html

By default html2vecty writes output on stdout. So writing to file is easy!
	$ html2vecty index.html > index.go

Done!
